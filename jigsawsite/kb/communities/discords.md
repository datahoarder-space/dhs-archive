# Community Discord Servers {#subreddits}

We are not affiliated in any way to the majority of the Discord Servers listed here, but we believe these servers can provide more insight and information to the data hoarder community on many topics and enable members of the community to discuss and explore topics with other like minded people.

### The Eye Discord Server {#d-the-eye}

The Eye has an established and active community on Discord. We frequently post news, sneak peaks and exclusive content releases to members on our Discord. We also actively take part in the community and spend time with our members. If you're interested in knowing more about The Eye, or perhaps have questions or suggestions, you know where to go. You can find out more about The Eye on their <a href="https://datahoarder.space/kb/the-eye">community page</a>.
