This section of our website is currently a work-in-progress. Our plans for this section include information on drives you can use, shucking external drives, servers, NAS systems and more. For now though, we recommend you check out <a href="https://serverbuilds.net">serverbuilds.net</a> as well as the JDM_WAAAT community for budget hardware and storage recommendations, or r/HomeLab in our Community Subreddits page for more server/hardware information.
