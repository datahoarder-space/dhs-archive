# Content organisation {#content-organisation}

This category covers software and tools to make it easier to organise and use your hoarded data.

* [Media](#media)

## Media {#media}

Media covers a wide range of data, including but not limited to movies, TV shows, documentaries, music, audiobooks, podcasts etc. What we cover here are software services that can cover all types of media organisation and consumption.

### Plex {#plex}

Plex is a closed-source media manager and server that can be used to organise and manage media, as well as serve it to most devices anywhere in the world. It is very straight forward to get up and running with, and has many content metadata providers making management of your library easier. 

You can also link it to live TV through DVRs and/or DVBs, as well as in the future have free access (ad-supported) to even more movies and TV shows than is in your library on-demand. 

It can be seen as a 'cutting the cord' solution as covers all forms of media well, and also provides access to other content that isn't in your library such as the on-demand services coming soon mentioned previously, and also a plethora of podcasts.
