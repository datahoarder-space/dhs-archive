pfSense is an open source firewall/router computer software distribution based on FreeBSD. It is installed on a physical computer or a virtual machine to make a dedicated firewall/router for a network. It can be configured and upgraded through a web-based interface, and requires no knowledge of the underlying FreeBSD system to manage. pfSense is commonly deployed as a perimeter firewall, router, wireless access point, DHCP server, DNS server, and as a VPN endpoint. pfSense supports installation of third-party packages like Snort or Squid through its Package Manager.

The pfSense project started in 2004 as a fork of the m0n0wall project by Chris Buechler and Scott Ullrich and the first release was in 2006. The name was derived from the fact that the software uses the packet-filtering tool, PF.


== History ==

In 2014 pfSense was acquired by Electric Sheep Fencing LLC (ESF) and the pfSense project license terms changed. Subsequently, in order to get further access to the pfSense build repositories, an appropriate ESF Contributor License Agreement had to be signed by developers.

pfSense version 2.2 was released January 23, 2015. Version 2.3 was released on April 12, 2016. Since July 2016, pfSense is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and since 2004 it is copyrighted, with the current copyright owner being Rubicon Communications, LLC (Netgate).

In November 2017, a World Intellectual Property Organization panel found that Netgate had been using the domain opnsense.com in bad faith to discredit OPNsense, and compelled Netgate to transfer the domain to Deciso, the developer of OPNsense. (OPNsense, launched in January 2015, is a fork and competitor of pfSense, which in turn was forked from m0n0wall, which was built on FreeBSD).
