Windows 8 is an Operating System made by Microsoft that is apart of the Windows NT family of Operating Systems. Microsoft started developing Windows 8 before Windows 7 released in 2009. Microsoft announced Windows 8 at CES 2011 and was followed by the release of 3 beta versions. Windows 8 was released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012 and was released to the public on October 26, 2012.

Windows 8 introduced big changes to Windows because it was now competing with mobile platforms like Android and iOS. Windows 8 is the first Microsoft Operating system that's optimized to be in use with a touchscreen using Microsoft's Metro design language. Windows 8 added support for USB 3.0, NFC, and additional security features like SecureBoot to prevent malware from infecting the boot process.

The operating system released with mixed feedback. Positive reviews were given to its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved touchscreen devices, but there were feedback about the confusing Metro design that replaced the classic start menu especially when used with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen. Even though Windows 8 wasn't as praised as much as Windows 7, It still went on to sold 60 million licenses by January 2013 (This figure includes both upgrades from previous versions of Windows and sales to OEMs for new PCs)

Microsoft released Windows 8.1 on October 17, 2013 to address the features that were criticized by critics. Windows 8.1 added additional improvements to different parts of the operating system. Windows 8.1 went on to be succeeded by Windows 10 in 2015. Support for Windows 8 ended in January 12, 2016 and Windows 8.1 must be installed to get support and updates
