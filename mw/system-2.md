System 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a flat file system named Macintosh File System (MFS). The Finder provides virtual folders that could be used to organize files, but these folders are not visible from any other application and do not actually exist on the disk.

System 2.0 added support for AppleTalk and the newly introduced LaserWriter to use it.
