# Getting Started {#getting-started}

Welcome to datahoarder.space. This is a knowledge base made specifically for the data hoarder community. This page details some basic information and how to on using the site.

## About us {#about-us}

Datahoarder.space originated under another site, datahoarderschool.club, in early 2018. Originally, it was a public-curated site with any user that registered being able to create pages and content to share with the other users of the site. This worked well, until it didn't. 

Around mid 2018 the mediawiki spambots found the site and hit it hard. They created so many spam accounts and pages that it was hard to even find a page that wasn't bot created and spam.

At that point, we took the site down and it has been down ever since. Sadly due to this, the discord community died off and grinded to a halt. There was complete uncertainty as to whether the project would return or would be able to return, but here we are, back now with staff-curated pages and content, and an even better site.

Following the non-renewal of our old domain due to the ridiculous renewal cost, we packed up our bags there and left. Following community-run polls (whilst the discord server was still somewhat alive), we decided on the domain datahoarder.space, and hopefully it is our place to stay.

So we welcome all, old and new, to the new datahoarder.space, and we hope our content will help others in our community to get more involved and learn more!

## Navigating datahoarder.space {#navigating-datahoarder-space}

Our new site is much easier to use and navigate than the previous mediawiki instance.

### Sidebar {#navigating-datahoarder-space-sidebar}

Throughout the knowledge base section of our website, there is a navigation sidebar (or for mobile users, a dropdown navigation). This sidebar/menu features clear indentation between parent and child pages to show our content categories and make it easier for you to navigate the site.

### Search {#navigating-datahoarder-space-search}

We hope to introduce a search function in the near future - stay tuned.

<!-- At the top of the page, there is now a search bar that automatically indexes keywords and sections to all of our knowledge base pages, meaning you can search for a term and find exactly what you need. -->
