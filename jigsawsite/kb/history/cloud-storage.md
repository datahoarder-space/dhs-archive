# Cloud storage {#cloud-storage}

Cloud storage plays a key role for many data hoarders in being able to store all of their hoarded data, although the services we have used to store our data has changed drastically and gone from service to service over time.

## Amazon Drive (formerly known as Amazon Cloud Drive) {#amazon-drive}

In March 2015, Amazon introduced unlimited cloud drive plans for non-business users. 

This soon caught the attention of many datahoarders, and based upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/5s7q04/i_hit_a_bit_of_a_milestone_today/">this reddit post where someone uploaded over a petabyte of webcam streams</a>, it can be presumed that amazon quickly caught on to the masses of storage that users began to use on their service at a very low monthly cost. 

Promptly after the over-a-petabyte upload and as more and more datahoarders uploaded masses of data to the platform, Amazon decided to pull the plug on the unlimited tier in June 2017. Users who had just transferred tens, hundreds or thousands of terabytes of data were now stuck as they either had to move the data promptly or change to Amazon's new (very steeply priced) plan at $50/terabyte/month.

## Google G Suite {#g-suite}

Google's G Suite service offering continues to this day to be the cloud storage of choice for many datahoarders, with it seemingly having no caps on its $10/user plan. 

We have even seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2F0wjoKEhg">Linus Media Group use it</a> to backup the 'Petabyte project', that is until they found the throttling limit around 150TB, but the proof-of-concept was there and proves it to be seemingly unlimited if you can get past the throttling.

## Microsoft Onedrive {#onedrive}

Microsoft's Onedrive has a lot of pricing structures dependent on whether you are a personal user, business user or Office 365 user. It seems to contend with G Suite with affordable storage plans such as 'unlimited' storage for Office 365's OneDrive for Business Plan 2 for £7.50/user/month or $10.00/user/month, and 6TB (1,000GB/user - 6 users) on Office 365 Home for £79.99/year or $99.99/year, which also includes the desktop version of Microsoft Office.

## AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 {#s3}

Amazon Web Service's S3 service is a long term mass storage solution for bulk data. It has many uses including usage by other AWS services/containers, but is rather expensive compared to alternatives.

## Backblaze B2 {#b2}

Backblaze's B2 service is also a long term mass storage solution for bulk data. Data is stored in 'buckets'. It is much cheaper than AWS S3, but there is still cheaper alternatives if you are just looking for long term mass storage.

## Wasabi Hot {#w-hot}

Wasabi's Hot Cloud Storage service is one of the cheapest in the long term mass storage market. It also claims to be much faster than the competition (B2/S3) and have a lot of appealing features to customers.
