## Their mission {#their-mission}

Living without the knowledge of our past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots. The Internet is a worldwide platform for sharing information. It is a community of common interests.

Our mission at The Eye is to preserve pieces of digital history. We are digital librarians.

## About The Eye {#about-us}

The Eye was born in April, 2017, starting out as a side project providing a public resource for varying collections and much smaller data-sets than we deal with today.

As of June 2019, the site is seeing 182 million+ requests amounting to over 1000 terabytes+ of data served each month. We currently pay around $600/month to cover our services and are entirely community funded.
