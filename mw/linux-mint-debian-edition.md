The Debian-based edition (LMDE) uses Debian as the software source base rather than Ubuntu. LMDE was originally based directly on Debian's Testing branch, but is designed to provide the same functionality and look and feel as the Ubuntu-based editions. LMDE has its own package repositories.

LMDE claims certain advantages and disadvantages compared to "Mint Main" (i.e., the Ubuntu-based editions):

*LMDE is faster and more responsive than Ubuntu-based editions.
*LMDE requires a deeper knowledge and experience with Linux and Debian package management.
*Debian is less user-friendly and desktop-ready than Ubuntu, with some rough edges.

==LMDE 1==

The original LMDE (now often referred to as LMDE 1) had a semi-rolling release development model, which periodically introduced "Update Packs" (tested snapshots of Debian Testing). Installing an Update Pack allowed one to keep LMDE 1 current, without having to reinstall the system every six months as with Mint Main. As of May 17, 2015, it has an upgrade path to LMDE 2.

==LMDE 2==

LMDE 2 (a.k.a. Betsy) was released on 10 Apr 2015,[59] becoming the current version of LMDE. LMDE 2 is based on Debian Stable, but receives automatic updates to the latest versions of MintTools and the installed desktop environment before they are released into the Mint Main edition. LMDE 2 is available with both the MATE and Cinnamon desktop environments.[55] Both image versions received an update in January 2017.

LMDE 2 remains based on sysvinit but with a "functional logind" from systemd.

==LMDE 3==

LMDE 3 (a.k.a. Cindy) is "very likely" to complete the switch to systemd from sysvinit. It will be based on Debian Stretch, is planned to be released in the first quarter of 2018, and will ship as a single edition with Cinnamon.
