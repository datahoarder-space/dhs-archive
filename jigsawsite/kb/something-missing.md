## Add using submission form {#something-missing-form}

As said above, we welcome contributors of content with open hands, as they help build our platform and knowledge base to better assist the rest of the community. We also understand that many members of our community may not have as strong of a knowhow when it comes to web frameworks and systems like the one we use and maintain. Therefore we have decided to make a google form where you can also submit any issues you spot on the site, missing information, whole articles to fill gaps in our content, and even a whole new section or category of information. Click the button below to head to the form.
