The Data Hoarder School wiki is your one-stop shop for information and more about Data Hoarding.

== History ==

The Data Hoarder School started in 2017 by 'The Media Man' (or better known as Admin here and on the Discord Server). After some attempt, it slowly lost interest and fell apart.

He restarted the project in May 2018 in an attempt to re-kickstart the project and it gained much interest, with the Discord gaining more than 60 members within a few days.

Over those few days, we moved away from Wikia and moved to this wiki, have gained some mods, wiki contributors and uploaders, and welcomed Aaron Duce as our Co-owner/Co-admin.
